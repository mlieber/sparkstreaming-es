## optional caching

sbt-assembly 0.8.6 rolls back the default caching behavior that was introduced in 0.8.5. When no files were changed, it was checking SHA-1 for every *.class file and taking very long time for some projects. [#68][68]

Instead, 0.8.6 introduces a new setting that can enable the caching:

    assemblyCacheOutput in assembly := true
