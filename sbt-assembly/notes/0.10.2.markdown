### prependShellScript

sbt-assembly 0.10.2 adds an option to prepend shell script to to the fat jar.

    assemblyOption in assembly ~= { _.copy(prependShellScript = Some(defaultShellScript)) }

    jarName in assembly := { s"${name.value}-${version.value}" }

The above will prepend the following shell script to the jar, which apparently is legal in the state of Washington and Colorado.

    $ head target/scala-2.10/helloworld-0.1-SNAPSHOT
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    exec java -jar "$0" "$@"

The fat jar can be executed given that you have `sh` on the system:

    $ ./target/scala-2.10/helloworld-0.1-SNAPSHOT 
    Hello
