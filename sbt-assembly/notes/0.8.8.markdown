### breaking: jarName is now a task

Good news for those who want to generate jar names dynamically. Thanks to [@dchenbecker][@dchenbecker], `jarName in assembly` is now a task [#74][74].

### quieter output

Previously sbt-assembly displayed an info-level log message for each file conflicts (some people include jars into jars). Most files are merged using the default 'deduplicate' strategy, which allows duplicates as long as the *content* of the files are identical. In some bigger projects, it was filling up 50,000 lines of "Merging xyz" log according to [@hrjet][@hrjet] in [#76][76]. He requested sbt-assembly to quiet down a bit.

sbt-assembly 0.8.8 will now demote 'deduplicate' logs to debug-level, and promote all other logs to warn-level, and display a summary at the end:

    [warn] Merging 'README' with strategy 'rename'
    [warn] Merging 'LICENSE' with strategy 'rename'
    [warn] Merging 'META-INF/MANIFEST.MF' with strategy 'discard'
    [info] Strategy 'deduplicate' was applied to a file (Run the task at debug level to see details)
    [warn] Strategy 'discard' was applied to a file
    [warn] Strategy 'rename' was applied to 2 files
