### shading

sbt-assembly 0.14.0 adds shading support backed by [Jar Jar Links][1].

    assemblyShadeRules in assembly := Seq(
      ShadeRule.rename("org.apache.commons.io.**" -> "shadeio.@1").inAll
    )

The above rule renames all classes in `org.apache.commons.io` to the `shadeio` package by bytecode transformation, including the references to them. For more details see [Shading](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly#shading).
