### MergeStrategy.concat change

`MergeStrategy.concat` will now append newline if the file terminates without it.
This is to work around Play Framework's `reference.conf` not containing newline at the end of the file. [#104][104], [#107][107] contributed by [@analytically][@analytically]

### assemblyPackageDependency fix

`assemblyPackageDependency` will now exclude internal dependencies from the fat JAR. By default it was already excluded from the JAR; however, when `exportJars := true` internal dependencies acted a JAR and was included as part of the resulting JAR prior to this release. Starting 0.11.0, `assemblyPackageDependency` will contain only the class files from external dependencies. [#103][103] reported by [@maliqq][@maliqq]
