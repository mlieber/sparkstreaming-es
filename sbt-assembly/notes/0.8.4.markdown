## minor enhancements and bug fixes

- Fixes Windows path handling. This was contributed by [@stejsks][@stejsks]

Now you can pattern match file paths to merge conflicting files at your own risk:

    mergeStrategy in assembly <<= (mergeStrategy in assembly) { (old) =>
      {
        case PathList("javax", "servlet", xs @ _*) => MergeStrategy.first
        case "application.conf" => MergeStrategy.concat
        case "unwanted.txt"     => MergeStrategy.discard
        case x => old(x)
      }
    }
